<div style="text-align: justify">
The Exploration in AI Today Workshop will focus on the question of how exploration can enable progress in modern AI. Answering this will require addressing both fundamental algorithmic questions, as well as application-driven challenges, such as (but not limited to):

<ul>
<li>How might we leverage prior knowledge&mdash;for example, in the form of a simulator or pretrained model&mdash;to enable effective exploration, and how might biases present in such prior knowledge affect the resulting exploration?</li>
<li>How can we effectively explore high-dimensional search spaces? In particular, how might we exploit the structure inherent in many high-dimensional settings of interest to enable effective exploration?</li>
<li>Uncertainty quantification historically has played a critical role in exploration: how can we quantify uncertainty effectively to direct exploration in high-dimensional settings such as language?</li>
<li>How can modern learning techniques (e.g. diffusion, in-context learning) be utilized in exploration?</li>
<li>How can we develop agents&mdash;LLM agents, robots, and beyond&mdash;that effectively explore their environment online to determine how to accomplish a desired goal?</li>
<li>Which experiments should we run in order to collect the most informative data to update our models&mdash;whether a language model, world model, model of biological interactions, or more?</li>
<li>What role can exploration play in reasoning, e.g., in searching and generating  chains of thought?</li>
</ul>

We welcome paper submissions addressing such questions, as well as other challenges related to exploration in AI, across domains such as:

<ul>
<li>LLMs, AI agents, and AI alignment.</li>
<li>Robotics and control.</li>
<li>AI for science and drug discovery.</li>
<li>Reinforcement learning.</li>
<li>Active learning, experiment design, and Bayesian optimization.</li>
<li>Recommendation systems and A/B testing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Best Paper Awards</h2>
We will be awarding a total of four best paper awards, with one award given to a paper in each of the following categories: LLMs, Robotics, AI for Science, and Theory. Each winning paper will be awarded a cash prize of <b>$500 USD</b>, and will be highlighed with a spotlight talk at the workshop.
