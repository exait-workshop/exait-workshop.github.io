How can we efficiently collect observations for optimization, control, and generalization? This is a key challenge in AI and is known as the exploration problem. Effective exploration has driven progress in areas such as robotics, recommender systems, and scheduled medical trials. However, as we address larger, more complex applications---such as drug discovery or language modeling---the exceptionally large search spaces render traditional exploration algorithms ineffective. As a result, recent breakthroughs in AI have come not from traditional exploration algorithms, but largely from training large foundation models on diverse corpora of pre-existing, curated datasets. Despite this, we have witnessed sparks showing that exploration, when done right, can compensate for data and computation---for example, in the training of DeepSeek-R1---suggesting that exploration can still play a key role in AI today.
